# predicting_air_pollution_measurements
In this repository I have tried to predict the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors.
This project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/data).
In addition, in this project, my effort has been to improve object-oriented programming skills.
##Models
For forecasting based on tabular data, I have used three models below:
- RandomForest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks (based on Embeding techniques)
